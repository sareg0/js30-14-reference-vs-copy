Some exercises to help learn the difference between a reference :book: and a copy :woman-with-bunny-ears-partying: https://youtu.be/YnfwDQ5XYF4


**A Reference**... points to the original. It is sometimes mistaken for copying because you can assign a reference to a variable, but beware!
If you alter it, you're altering the original

**A Copy**.. is just that. An exact copy of something, but not that exact array or object anymore. You can change your the copy and note
affect the original, because it's not the original anymore! \o/

Take a look at index.js and run it in your browser of choice to manipulate the references and copies and learn 
different ways to copy arrays and objects.
