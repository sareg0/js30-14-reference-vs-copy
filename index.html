    let name = 'Sara!'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2)
    name = "Changed!"
    console.log(name, name2)

    let num2 = num1

    console.log(num1, num2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const newPlayers = players
    console.log(newPlayers)


    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // newPlayers[2] = 'CoCo'

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team = players.slice()
    team[1] = 'Phillip'

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team1 = [].concat(players)
    team1[3] = "Turanga"

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team2 = [...players]
    team2[0] = "Bender"

    const team3 = Array.from(players)
    team2[0] = "Cubert"

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const newPerson = person
    // newPerson.number = 88

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const superPerson = Object.assign({}, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const superPerson = {...person}
    // it's here!!!! :point_up: :point_up: 


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
